**Entailment Trees** represents a chain of reasoning that shows how a hypothesis (or an answer to a question) can be explained from simpler textual evidence.

**Iterative Retrieval-Generation Reasoner** our proposed architecture that iteratively searches for suitable premises, constructing a single entailment step at a time. At every generation step, the model searches for a distinct set of premises that will support the generation of a single step, therefore mitigating the language modelâ€™s input size limit and improving generation correctness.

## Setting Up Environemnt

First you need to install the dependencies of the project:

```bash
conda env create --file irgr.yml
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then activate your conda environment:

```bash
conda activate irgr
```

### Setting up Jupyter

Most of the code is wrapped inside Jupyter Notebooks.

You can either start a Jupyter server locally or follow the AWS instructions on how to setup the jupyter notebook on EC2 instances and access it through your browser:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/setup-jupyter.html

### Data Folder Structure
   
You can download the [Entailment Bank](https://allenai.org/data/entailmentbank) data and evaluation code by running:

```
python setup.py
```

### Running Experiments

You can re-start the kernel and run the whole notebook to execute data-loading / training / evaluation

dada loading has to be done before executing training and evaluation.

#### Entailment Tree Generation

The main model's code is in `src/entailment_iterative.ipynb`.

The model can generate explanations and proofs for EntailmentBank dataset.

#### Premise Retrieval

The main model's code is in `src/entailment_retrieval.ipynb`.

This model retrieves a set of premises from the corpus. Training uses the EntailmentBank + World Tree V2 corpus.

    abstract = "Large language models have achieved high performance on various question answering (QA) benchmarks, but the explainability of their output remains elusive. Structured explanations, called entailment trees, were recently suggested as a way to explain the reasoning behind a QA system{'}s answer. In order to better generate such entailment trees, we propose an architecture called Iterative Retrieval-Generation Reasoner (IRGR). Our model is able to explain a given hypothesis by systematically generating a step-by-step explanation from textual premises. The IRGR model iteratively searches for suitable premises, constructing a single entailment step at a time. Contrary to previous approaches, our method combines generation steps and retrieval of premises, allowing the model to leverage intermediate conclusions, and mitigating the input size limit of baseline encoder-decoder models. We conduct experiments using the EntailmentBank dataset, where we outperform existing benchmarks on premise retrieval and entailment tree generation, with around 300{\%} gain in overall correctness.",
